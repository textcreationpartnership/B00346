            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <head>¶ AN OTHER PRAYER that may sometimes be vsed after the Sermon.</head>
               <p>ALmightie God and heauenlie Father, since thou hast promised to graunt our requestes, which wee shall make vnto thee in the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ thy welbeloued Sonne, and that we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so taught by him &amp; his Apostles, to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selues in his Name, promising that he will be among vs, and make intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for vs vnto thee, for the obtayning of all such things, as we shall agree vpon here in earth: we therefore (hauing first thy cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to pray for such as thou hast appointed rulers and gouuernours ouer vs, &amp; also for all things needfull both for thy people, &amp; for all sortes of men, forasmuch as our faith is groūded on thine holy word and promises, and that we are heere gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red togither before thy face, &amp; in the name of thy Sōne our Lord Iesus) we, I say, make our earnest supplicatiō vnto thee, our most mercifull God and bountifull Father, that for Iesus Christes sake our onely Sauiour &amp; Mediator, it may please thee of thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercie freelie to pardō our offences, and in such sorte to draw and lift vp our heartes &amp; affections towards thee, that our
<pb facs="tcp:180988:12"/> requestes may both proceed of a feruent minde, and also be agreeable vnto thy most blessed will and pleasure, which is onlie to be accepted.</p>
               <p>(·) We beseeche thee therefore, O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie Father, for all Princes and Rulers, vnto whom thou hast cōmitted the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of thy iustice, and namelie, for the excellent estate of the Queenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, and all her Honorable Counsell, with the rest of her Magistrates and Commons of the Realme, that it would please thee to graunt her thine holy Spirit, and increase the same frō time to time in her, that shee may with a pure faith acknowledge IESVS Christ thine onely Sonne our Lord, to bee King of all kings, &amp; gouuernor of all gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, euen as thou hast giuen all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vnto him both in heauen and in earth: and so giue her selfe wholie to serue him, and to aduaunce his kingdome in her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, ruling according to thy worde, her subiectes, which are thy creatures, and the sheepe of thy pasture, that wee beeing mainteyned in peace and tranquillitie, may serue thee in all holinesse and vertue: and finallie, being deliuered from all feare of enimies,<note place="margin">Luke. 15.</note> may render thankes vnto thee all the dayes of our life.</p>
               <p>We beseeche thee also most deare Father,
<pb facs="tcp:180988:12"/> for all such as thou hast appointed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters vnto thy faithfull people, and vnto whom thou hast committed the charge of soules, and the ministerie of thine holy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, that it would please thee so to guide them with thine holy Spirit, that they may be found wise, faithfull and zealous of thy glorie, directing alwayes their whole stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies vnto this ende, that the poore sheepe whiche are gone astray out of thy flocke, may be sought out &amp; brought againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord Iesus, who is the chiefe Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard and Prince of Pastors, to the intent they may from day to day grow &amp; increase in him to all righteousnesse and holinesse. And on the other parte, that it would please thee to deliuer all the Churches from the daūgers of rauening Wolues, and frō hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, who seeke their owne ambition and profit, and not the setting forth of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie onely, and the safegarde of thy flocke.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, wee make our prayers vnto thee, ô Lorde God, most mercifull Father, for all men, that as thou wouldest haue all sortes of men saued, &amp; come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the trueth: so it may please thee, that such as haue bene hitherto holdē cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in darknesse &amp; ignorance, for lacke of the knowledge of thy Gospel, may through the preaching thereof, and the cleare light
<pb facs="tcp:180988:13"/> of thine holy Spirit, bee brought into the right way of saluation, which is, to knowe thee the onely true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent. Likewise, that they whom thou hast alreadie endued with thy grace, &amp; illuminated their hearts with the knowledge of thy Worde, may continually increase in godlinesse, and bee plenteouslie enriched with spirituall benefites: So that we may altogither worship thee, both with heart and mouth, and render due honor &amp; seruice vnto Christ our Lord.</p>
               <p>In like maner, ô Lord of all true comfort, we commende vnto thee in our prayers all such persons as thou hast visited &amp; chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with any crosse and tribulatiō: all such people as thou hast punished with pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, warre, or famine: and all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons afflicted with pouertie, imprisonmēt, sicknesse, banishmēt, or any like bodily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie, or hast otherwise afflicted in spirit: that it may please thee to make them feele thy fatherlie affection towardes them, and to know that these crosses are chastisemēts for their amendement, to the end that they may vnfainedlie turne vnto thee, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue full comfort, and be deliuered from their euills. But especiallie wee commende vnto thy diuine protection, all such as are vnder the tyrannie of Antichrist, and both lacke the preaching of the Word, the food
<pb facs="tcp:180988:13"/> of life, &amp; haue not libertie to call vpon thy Name in opē Assemblie: chieflie our poore brethren which are imprisoned and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the enimies of thy Gospell, that it may please thee, O Father of consolations, to strengthen them by the power of thine H. Spirit, in such sort, as they neuer shrink backe, but may cōstantly perseuere in their holy faith, &amp; so to succour and assist them, as thou knowest to be most expedient: com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forting them in their afflictions, maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them in thy safegard against the rage of the enimies, and increasing in them the giftes of thy holy Spirit, that they may glorifie thee their Lord God, both in their life and in their death.</p>
               <p>Finallie, ô Lord God most deare Father, wee beseeche thee, to graunt vnto vs also, which are heere gathered togither in the Name of thy Sonne Iesus Christ, to heare his Word preached,<note n="“" place="margin">If y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lords Supper bee ministred, then is here added this clause, <hi>And to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate his holy Supper.</hi>

               <p>O God almightie and heauenly Father, we acknowledge in our cōsciences &amp; cōfesse, as the trueth is, that we are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to lift vp our eyes to heauē, much lesse meet to come into thy presence, &amp; to be so bold as to thinke that thou wilt heare our prayers, if thou haue respect to that which is in vs: for our consciences accuse vs, and our owne sinnes doe beare witnesse against vs: yea, and wee know that thou art a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Iudge, which punished the faultes of such as transgresse thy commaundements. Therefore, ô Lorde, when we consider our whole life, we haue cause to be cōfoundeth in our own hearts, and to be swallowed vp in the deep gulfe of death. Notwithstāding most mercifull Lorde, since it hath pleased thee of thine infinit mercie to cōmaund vs to call vpon thee for helpe, euen from the deepe bottome of hell: and that the more lack &amp; defaut we fele in ourselues, so much the rather we shuld haue recourse vnto thy gratious boūtie: since also thou hast promi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed to heare &amp; accept our requestes &amp; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, without hauing anie respect to our vnworthines, for the merits of our lord Iesus Christ, whom alone thou hast appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to bee our Intercessour and Aduocate, we humble our selues before thee, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all vaine confidence in mans helpe,
<pb facs="tcp:180988:16"/> and cleaue onelie to thy mercie, calling v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thy holy Name, to obteine pardon for our sinnes.</p>
               <p>First, O Lorde, besides the innumerable benefites which thou doest vniuersallie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe vpon al men, thou hast giuen vs such speciall graces, that it is not possible for vs to rehearse them, no nor sufficientlie to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them in our mindes. It hath pleased thee to call vs to the knowledge of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gospell, drawing vs out of the miserable bondage of the Deuill, whose slaues wee were, and deliuering vs from most cursed idolatrie and wicked superstition, wherein we were plunged, to bring vs into the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous light of thy trueth. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such is our vnthankfulnesse, that not onely we forget those thy benefites whiche we haue receyued at thy bountifull hande, but haue gone astray from thee, and haue turned our selues from thy Law, to goe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our owne concupiscences &amp; lustes, and neither haue giuen worthie honour &amp; due obedience to thine holy Worde, neither haue aduanced thy glorie, as our duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. And although thou hast not ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed continually to admonish vs most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie by thy Worde, yet we haue not giuen eare to thy Fatherlie admonition.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ô Lord, wee haue sinned and
<pb facs="tcp:180988:16"/> haue grieuouslie offended against thee, so that shame and confusion appertayneth to vs: and we acknowledge that wee are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither guiltie before thy iudgement, and that if thou wouldest deale with vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our demerites, we could looke for no other then euerlasting death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For although we would excuse our selues, yet our owne conscience would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse vs, and our wickednes would appeare before thee to condemne vs. And in verie deed, O Lorde, wee see by the corrections which thou hast alreadie laid vpon vs, that we haue giuē thee great occasion to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with vs: for seeing thou art a iust &amp; vpright Iudge, it can not be without cause, that thou punishest thy people. Wherefore, for as much as we haue felt thy stripes, wee acknowledge that we haue iustlie stirred vp thy displeasure against vs: yea, and yet wee see thine hande lifted vp to strike vs again: for the roddes &amp; weapons wherewith thou art accustomed to execute thy vengeance, are alreadie in thine hande, and in full rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse. Wherewith though thou shouldest punish vs much more grieuouslie thē thou hast hitherto done, and that, whereas wee haue receyued one stroke, thou wouldest giue vs a thousande: yea, if thou wouldest bring vpon vs all the curses written in thy
<pb facs="tcp:180988:17"/> Law, and pursue vs with the grieuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, wherewith thou diddest punish thy people Israell, wee confesse that thou shouldest doe therein most righteouslie, &amp; we can not denie, but we haue fullie deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the same. Notwithstanding, ô Lorde, our heauenlie Father, seeing thou art our maker, and we the workmanship of thine hands, seeing thou art our Pastor, &amp; we thy flocke: seing also that thou art our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and wee the people whom thou hast bought: finallie, because thou art our God, &amp; we thy chosen Heritage, suffer not thine anger so to kindle against vs, that thou shouldest punish vs in thy wrath, neither remember our wickednes so, as to take vē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance therof, but rather chastise vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy mercie. We confesse, O Lord, that our misdeedes haue enflamed thy wrath against vs, yet, cōsidering that by thy grace we call vpon thy Name, &amp; make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of thy trueth: mainteine, we beseech thee, the worke that thou hast begon in vs, to the ende that all the worlde may knowe that thou art our God and Sauiour. Thou knowest that such as thou hast destroyed &amp; brought to confusion, do not set forth thy prayses, but the heauie soules, the humble hearts, the consciences oppressed, &amp; loaden with the grieuous burden of their sinnes,
<pb facs="tcp:180988:17"/> and therefore thirste after thy grace, they shall set foorth thy prayse and glorie.</p>
               <p>Thy people of Israel oftētimes prouoked thee to anger through their wickednesse, whervpon thou diddest iustlie punishe thē: but so soone as they acknowledged their offences, and returned to thee, thou diddest receiue them alwayes to mercie: and were their enormities &amp; sins neuer so grieuous, yet for thy Couenantes sake which thou haddest made with thy seruāts, Abrahā Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac &amp; Iacob, thou diddest alwaies withdraw frō them thy roddes &amp; curses, which were prepared for them, in such sorte, that thou diddest neuer refuse to heare their prayers.</p>
               <p>We haue obtained by thy goodnesse, in a farre more excellent maner, the same Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, stablished by the meanes of IESVS Christ our Sauior, written with his bloud, &amp; sealed with his death and passion. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O Lord, we renouncing our selues, &amp; all vaine cōfidence in mans helpe, haue our onely refuge to this thy most blessed Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereby our Lord Iesus, through the offering vp of his body in sacrifice, hath reconciled vs vnto thee. Behold vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O Lorde, in the face of Christ thine annoynted, that by his intercession, thy wrath &amp; indignation may be appeased, and that the grieuous plagues and iudgements
<pb facs="tcp:180988:18"/> which we haue deserued, may be remoued from vs, and that the bright beames of thy countenance may shine vpon vs, to our great comfort and assured saluation: and from this time forwarde, vouchsafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue vs vnder thine holy tuition, and gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne vs with thy holy Spirit, whereby we may bee regenerate a new vnto a farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life.</p>
               <p>And albeit we be most vnworthie in our owne selues, to open our mouthes, and to intreate thee in our necessities, yet for so much as it hath pleased thee to commaund vs to pray one for another, wee make also our hūble prayers vnto thee, for our poore brethren, whom thou doest visite and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise with thy roddes and corrections, most instantly desiring thee, to turne away thine anger from them. Remember, ô Lorde, that they are thy children, as wee are: and though they haue offended thy Maiestie, yet we beseech thee that it may please thee not to cease to proceede in thine accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med bountie and mercie, which thou hast promised, should euermore continue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes thine elect. Vouchsafe therefore, ô Lorde, to extende thy pitie vppon all thy Churches, and towardes all thy people, whom thou doest now chastise, either with pestilence or warre, or such like thine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
<pb facs="tcp:180988:18"/> roddes, as sicknesse, prison, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, or any other affliction of body or minde, that it would please thee to cōfort them as thou knowest to bee most expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for them, so that thy roddes may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions for them, to assure them of thy fauour, &amp; for their amendement, whē thou shalt giue them constancie and patience, &amp; also asswage and stay thy corrections: and so at length by deliuering them frō al their troubles, giue them iust occasion to reioice in thy mercie, and to praise thine Holie Name.

                  <hi>Forasmuch as it is not permitted by Gods Worde, that women, or any priuate person should preache or minister the Sacramentes, and it is euident that the Sacraments are not ordained of god to be vsed but in places of the publike Congregation, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarilie annexed to the preaching of the Worde, as seales of the same, therefore the infant which is to be baptized, shalbe brought to the Church at some day appointed to common prayer and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, accompanied with the Father &amp; godfathers, as the Eldership of that Congregation shall think conuenient. After the Sermon, the childe beeing presented to the Minister, hee demaundeth this question:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DOe you present this Childe to bee Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized?</p>

                  <hi>The Aunswere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, we require the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Pastor is to proceed, saying:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THen let vs cōsider, dearlie beloued, how Almightie God hath not onely made vs his children by "adoption, and receiued vs into the fellowship of his Church, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hath promised that he wil be our<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 17. Exod. 12.</note> God,
<pb facs="tcp:180988:20"/> and the God of our childrē, vnto the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande generation. Which thing as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to his people of the olde Testament by the Sacrament of<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 17. Roma. 4.</note> Circūcision, so hath he also renewed the same to vs in his newe Testament by the Sacrament of<note n="b" place="margin">Colo 1 Galat. 3 Actes 2.</note> Baptisme: commaunding his<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 8. Marke. 16.</note> Apostles to baptize in the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost: declaringe thereby that such as beleeue, and their infantes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to him by couenant, and therfore ought not to bee defrauded of those Holie signes and seales<note n="d" place="margin">Actes 10.</note> whereby his childrē are knowne from infidels and pagans.</p>
               <p>Neither is it requisite, that all those that receiue this Sacrament, haue the vse of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and faith, but that they be cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined vnder the name of<note n="e" place="margin">Actes. 2. 1 Cor. 7.</note> Gods people: so that remission of sinnes in the bloud of Christ Iesus, doeth appertaine vnto them by Gods promise.</p>
               <p>This thing is most euident by<note n="f" place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> S<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Paule, who pronounceth the children begotten &amp; borne, either of the parents being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to be cleane and holie.

Which testimonies of the holy Ghost assure vs, that infants be of the number of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that remission of sinnes doeth also
<pb facs="tcp:180988:20"/> appertaine to them in Christ. Therefore without iniurie, they can not bee debarred from the common signe of Gods children.

               <p>Furthermore, it is euident, that Baptisme was ordeyned to bee ministred in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt of<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 3. 1 Pet. 3. 1 Iohn. 5 1 Cor. 10</note> water, to teach vs, that like as water outwardlie doeth washe away the filth of the bodie, so inwardlie doeth the bloode of Christ purge our soules from that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and deadlie poyson, wherewith<note n="d" place="margin">Ephe. 2.</note> by nature we were infected.

               <p>LET vs marke, deare brethren, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how Iesus Christ did ordaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs his Holie Supper, according as Saint Paule maketh rehearshall in the 11. Chap. of the firste Epistle to the Corinthians, saying:</p>
               <p>I haue receyued of the Lord, that which I haue deliuered vnto you, to witte, that the Lord Iesus the same night he was betrayed, tooke bread, and when he had giuen thankes, he brake it saying: Take yee, eate ye, this is my bodie, which is broken for you: do you this in remembrance of mee. Likewise after Supper, hee tooke the Cup, saying: This Cuppe is the new Testament or Couenant in my bloud: doe yee this so ofte as yee shall drinke thereof, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of mee. For so ofte as you shall eate this bread, and drinke of this Cuppe, yee shall declare the Lords death vntill his comminge. Therfore whosoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:180988:24"/> shall eate this breade, &amp; drinke the Cuppe of the Lorde vnworthily, he shall be guiltie of the body and bloud of the Lorde. Then see that euery man prooue &amp; trie him selfe, and so let him eate of this breade, &amp; drinke of this Cuppe, for who so euer eateth or drinketh vnworthily, he eateth &amp; drinketh his owne damnation, for not hauing due regarde and consideration of the Lords bodie.</p>

For as the benefite is great, if with a truelie penitent heart, and liuelie faith wee receyue that holie Sacrament (for then wee spirituallie eate the fleshe of Christ, &amp; drinke his bloude: thē wee dwell in Christ, and Christ in vs: we be one with Christ, &amp; Christ with vs:) so is the daunger exceeding great, if wee receyue this holie Sacramente vnworthilie: for then wee be guiltie of the

               <head>THE MANNER OF OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAINING MINISTERS OF the Worde, and establishing them in their Churches.</head>
               <p>WElbeloued Brethren in the Lord, it is knowen to you all, that wee haue three or foure times propoūded vnto you the name of our deare brother N. heere present, to know whether anie man had to except against him cōcerning his doctrine and conuersation, whereby he were to bee helde vnfit for the Ministerie in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. But so it is, that no man appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, to alleadge anie lawfull exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: wherfore we are at this present time to proceed in the Name of the Lorde to his institution. For the which cause, you N. &amp; all that be heere present, are to heare a short declaration out of the Scripture, concerning the institution and charge of the Ministers of the worde: Namelie, that our heauēlie Father, purposing to call and gather out of mankinde, being corrupted, a Church vnto life euerlasting, doeth by a speciall grace vse therevnto the labour of men: as S. Paule teacheth vs <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. That the Lord <hi>Christ gaue some to be Apostles, &amp; some Prophetes, and some Euangelistes, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:180988:35"/> some Pastors and Teachers: for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together of the Saints, for the worke of the Ministerie, and for the edification of the body of Christ.</hi> Heere wee see plainlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things, that the Pastors office is an institution of Iesus Christ. Nowe to know what belōgeth to this holy charge, wee may easilie gather out of the name it selfe. For as the duetie of a common Pastor or Sheepheard is to feede, to leade, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende and gouerne the flock that is cōmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him: so doeth it also stande with those spirituall sheepheardes, set ouer that Cōgregation, the which God calleth vnto saluation, and holdeth to be the sheepe of his pasture. Which pasture to graze these sheepe withall, is nothing els but the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Gods word, with the annexed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of prayers and of the holie Sacramentes. The same worde is also that staffe, whereby this flocke is guided and gouerned. Consequentlie it is plaine, that the charge of Pastours or Ministers consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth therein:</p>
               <p>First, that they are vppon good ground, soundlie to deliuer vnto the people the worde of the Lotd, cōtained in the bookes of the Prophetes and Apostles: and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie the same both in general and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, to the vtilitie &amp; profit of the hearers,
<pb facs="tcp:180988:35"/> by instructing, admonishing, comfortinge and rebuking them, according as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of euerie one requireth: preaching conuersion vnto God, and reconciliation with him through faith in Iesus Christ, &amp; refuting by the holy Scriptures all errours &amp; heresies that are repugnāt to this sound doctrine. All which is taught vs plainlie in the holy Scriptute. For the Apostle Saint Paule saith, That these doe labour in the worde. And elswhere:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.17 Rom. 12.3.</note> That it is to be done according to the measure or rule of faith. Moreouer,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.9. 2 Tim. 2.15 1 Cor. 14.3</note> that a Pastor must hold fast that faithfull worde according to doctrine, and deuide the same aright. Also, He that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecieth (that is that preacheth the word) speaketh vnto men to edifying,<note place="margin">Act. 20.20.</note> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, &amp; to comfort. In an other place he doeth set downe him self for a patron vnto all Pastors, declaring that openlie and throughout the houses, hee hath taught repentance towards God, and faith toward our lord Iesus Christ. But specially he doth deliuer vnto vs a notable description of the charge of a Preacher of the Gospell 2. Cor. 5.17.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17.</note>
                  <hi>All thinges</hi> (saith hee) <hi>are of God, which hath reconciled vs vnto himselfe by Iesus Christ, and hath giuen vnto vs (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Apostles and Pastors) the ministerie of reconciliation. For God was in Christ recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
<pb facs="tcp:180988:36"/> the word to himselfe, not imputing their sinnes vnto them: and hath committed vnto vs the worde of reconciliation. Now then are wee Ambassadours for Christ: as though God did beseech you through vs, wee pray you in Christes steade, that ye be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God.</hi> Concerning the refuting of false doctrine, the same Apostle saith Tit. 1.9. that a Minister must hold fast the word of God, that he may convince them that speake against it.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, the Pastors charge is, to make publike prayers in the behalf of the whole church, for that which the Apostles say, Act. 6.4. we will giue our selues cōtinually to prayer, &amp; to the ministery of the word, is cōmen to al Pastors.<note place="margin">1 Timo. 2.</note> Therfore S. Paul saith to Timothe, <hi>J exhort, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thankesgiuings be made for all men, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdlie, they are to administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Math. 28.</note> which the Lord hath ordained to be seals of his grace, as it appeareth by the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandmēt that Christ gaue to his Apostles, belonging also to all other Pastors, Baptise them in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, &amp; of the holy Ghost. Also 1 Cor. 11 I haue receaued of the Lorde that which I also deliuered vnto you, to wit, That the Lorde Iesus in the night when hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,
<pb facs="tcp:180988:36"/> tooke bread, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Finally, the Pastors ought to maintaine &amp; gouerne the church of God in good disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, after the maner that the Lorde hath appointed. For Christ Math. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. hauing spoken of the Christian censures, saith to his Apostles, <hi>What soeuer ye shal binde vpō earth, shall be bound in heauen.</hi> And Paule will haue the Ministers to bee able to gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne well their own house,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.5</note> because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they should not be able to rule the Church of God.<note place="margin">Tit. 1.7.</note> Therefore are the Pastors called in the Scriptue <hi>Stewards</hi> &amp; <hi>Bishops,</hi> that is to say, Ouerseers &amp; Watchmen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue the ouersight ouer the house of God in the which they conuerse, to the end that all things may be done in it orderlie, decentlie, and honestlie: and that by the keyes of the kingdome of heauen,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.19.</note> that are committed vnto them, the shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and opening may be practised, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the charge that God hath giuen them.</p>
               <p>By these things ye may see, what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent work the Pastors office is, seeing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by so great thinges are brought to passe: yea how necessarie it is in all respectes, to bring men vnto saluatiō. For which cause the Lord willeth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same to remain alwayes: seeing he said to his Apostles, when he sent
<pb facs="tcp:180988:37"/> them out to execute this holie ministerie, <hi>Lo I am with you alway vnto the end of the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 28.</note> Whereby he sheweth his will is, that his holie Ministerie (considering the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles could not liue vntill the ende of the world) from time to time should be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vpon earth. Therefore Paul also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisheth Timothe, <hi>That what thinges he had heard of him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Timo. 2.2</note>
                  <hi>he should deliuer to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, that were able to teach others like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi> And hauing ordained Titus to bee a Pastor,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.5.</note> commaundeth him further to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Elders in euerie Cittie.</p>
               <p>Considering then that we also, to entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the same Ministerie in the Church of God, doe ordaine or admit this our<note n="“" place="margin">or brothers</note> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther N. &amp; haue hetherto sufficientlie spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his chariage: You therfore N. shall aunswere vpon that which I am to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proud vnto you, to the end that euerie one may vnderstand that you are minded to accept the same charge in a conuenient manner.</p>
               <p>First I aske you, whether you feele in your heart that you are called lawfullie by the church of God, and consequentlie by God himselfe, to this holie ministerie?</p>
               <p>Secondlie, whether you hold the bookes of the old and new Testament to be the onlie word of God &amp; the perfect doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:180988:37"/> of saluation: and doe forsake all doctrines repugnant vnto the same:</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, whether you promise to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute your charge as before it is described, with all fidelitie according to the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: and to execute &amp; accompanie your instructions with a godlie life: as also to submit your self to the Church-censures, according to the common order of the Churches, if it happē that you should mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie your selfe either in doctrine or life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpon this he aunswereth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea with all my heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then shall the Minister who hath asked him these questions (or an other Minister when there are more) lay their "handes vpō his head, and speake thus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">NOTE, That this ce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>remonie is not vsed in the cōfirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those that haue bin orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before: but onelie the geuing of hands af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> "<hi>handes vpō his head, and speake thus:</hi>

Loue Christ, and feede his sheepe, hauing a care of them, not by constraint, but willinglie: not for filthie lucre, but of a readie minde: not as though you were a Lorde ouer the people committed vnto you, but as beeing become a paterne vnto the flocke.

Let the feete of them that publish peace, and declare good things, be beautifull and acceptable vnto you. Obey them that haue the ouersight of you: for they watch for your soules, as they that must giue account: that they may doe it with ioy, and not with griefe: for that is vnprofitable for you. By doeing so, the peace of God shall enter into your houses, &amp; you receyuing this man in the name of a Prophete, shall receyue the rewarde of a Prophete: and by his worde, beleeuing in Christ, shall inherite life euerlasting.

Moreouer, it is good that such fellow ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb facs="tcp:180988:40"/> bee ioyned with the Ministers of the worde, to the end that hereby all tyrannie and dominion may more easilie bee bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed out of the Church of God, the which may breake in the sooner, when the gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement consisteth but in one or verie fewe persons. So that the Ministers of the worde and the Elders togeather, make one fellowship, beeing as a Church-councill, &amp; representing the whole Church.

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18.17</note> The which can not be vnderstood of all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie member of the Church seuerallie, but most fitlie of those that gouuerne the Church, by the which they are elected.</p>
               <p>First, there is required of the Elders, to haue with the Ministers of the worde, an ouersight of the Church, that is cōmitted vnto them: carefullie to looke that euerie one behaue him selfe convenientlie in his profession and conuersation, To admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe those that giue offence: and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, as much as is possible, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be not prophaned. Likewise, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Christian discipline, to deale against the impenitent, and receiue againe the penitēt into the bosome of the church: as not onely it is made plaine by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sentence of Christ, but also by other
<pb facs="tcp:180988:41"/> testimonies of Scripture,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.4 2 Cor. 2.6.7</note> that these things stande not by one or two persons only, but by manie that are appointed fot it.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, seeing the Apostle comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that all thinges amonge Christians,<note place="margin">Cor. 14.40.</note> shall be done comelie and by order, and that no mā without lawfull calling, ought to serue in the Church of Christ, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian order requireth: It belongeth also to the Elders to looke to this, and in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that fall out appertayning to a good constitution &amp; order of the Church, with good coūsell to assiste the Ministers of the worde: yea with counsell and comfort to serue the whole Congregation.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, it is their charge to haue a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regarde of the doctrine and life of the Ministers of the worde, to the end that all thinges be seruing for the edifying of the Church: and that no straung doctrine be taught, as we see the Apostle doeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte,<note place="margin">Act. 20.28.29.</note> that diligent watch bee held against the wolues that might enter into the sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat of Christ. For the performing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Elders are bound carefully to search the word of God, &amp; to exercise themselues continuallie in the meditation of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the Deacons, we may reade of their originall &amp; institution in the Actes</hi>

                  <pb facs="tcp:180988:41"/>
                  <hi>of the Apostles. For there we doe finde that in the beginning the Apostles themselues, ministred to the poore, at whose feete the price of the sold goodes were brought, and the distribution was done to euerie one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his necessitie required. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause after this there arose a murmuringe, for that the widowes of the Graecians were neglected in the daylie ministring: By the admonitiō of the Apostles, certain men were chosen to supplie this busines of prouidinge for the poore, that the Apostles might giue themselues continuallie to prayer and to the ministration of the word. From which time this hath bin obserued in the Church, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by Paul the Apostle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12.8.</note>
                  <hi>who speaking of this charge, saith: That he who distributeth, shall doe it with simplicitie. And els where speaking of the</hi> HELPERS,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.28.</note>
                  <hi>he vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth those that are appointed to helpe the poore and afflicted, in their neede. Which places do sufficientlie shew what the office is of the Deacons: Namelie first, That they with fidelitie &amp; carefulnesse doe gather and keepe the almes and goodes which are giuen to the poore: yea labour besides with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that many good meanes may be found for the reliefe of the poore. The second parte of their charge consisteth in the distribution: wherevnto is requisit, not onelie discretion
<pb facs="tcp:180988:42"/> &amp; prudencie, least they should giue where is no need: but also a ioyfull mind &amp; simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to helpe the poore with a cheerefull and mercifull heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12.8</note>
                  <hi>as the Apostle requireth. To which purpose it is verie good, that they succcour the poore &amp; afflicted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.7.</note>
                  <hi>not only with outwarde giftes, but likewise with comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table consolations out of the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the end therefore, deare brethren, N.

               <p>First, I aske you Elders, <hi>and Deacons,</hi> whether you doe not feele in your heartes, that you are by the Church of God, and consequentlie by God him selfe, seuerallie called to this holy charge, [or charges?]</p>
               <p>Secondlie, whether you holde the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of the Old and New Testament, to be the onelie worde of God, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect doctrine of saluation, and doe reiect all doctrine contrarie vnto the same?</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, whether you promise to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister your charge (as before it is described out of the said doctrine) with all fidelitie, according to your power: namely you El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders N.N, in the church gouernement, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
<pb facs="tcp:180988:42"/> with the Ministers of the worde, <hi>And you Deacons N. N. in the ministring of the poore?</hi> Likewise whether <hi>all of you,</hi> doe promise to liue in a godlie conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; to submit your selues to the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie admonitions and censures, if you at any time offend against the good order of the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpon this they shall answer:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, that we doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Minister sayeth:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Almightie God and Father, graunt vnto you all his grace, that in this your charge you may behaue your selues faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie and fruitfullie with comfort, Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then shall he admonish them and the Congregation in this maner:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Looke then ye Elders that ye be diligent in gouerning the Church that which (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Ministers of the worde) is committed vnto you. Be also good watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ouer the house and citie of God, to admonish euerie one faithfully, and warne him of his destructiō. Haue a care to main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine the purenes of doctrine, and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of life in the Church of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And you Deacons, be carefull in the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Almes, circumspect and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in bestowing them: helpe the distressed, prouide for the right Widowes and orphans:
<pb facs="tcp:180988:43"/> doe good vnto all men, but speciallie vnto them which are of the housholde of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be all of you faithfull and trustie in your charge: and hold the mysterie of faith in a pure conscience, shewing good exāple vnto all the people. So shall you get to your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues a good degree and great libertie in the faith which is in Christ Iesus, &amp; hereafter enter into the ioye of your Lord.</p>
               <p>On the other side welbeloued Christians, receaue these men as the seruants of God. Estime the Elders that rule well worthy of double honor: submit your selues willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to their ouersight and rule: <hi>Prouide and furnish the Deacons of good meanes for the helping of the poore: Bee beneficiall ye that are rich, giue liberallie and impart readilie: And ye that are poore, be poore in spirit, &amp; carie your selues reuerentlie towardes your prouiders: be thankefull towards them, and murmure not: follow Christ for the foode of the soule, and not for bread sake. Let him that hath stolen, or bene burthensome to his neighbour, steale no more, but let him rather labour and worke with his handes the thing which is good, that he may haue to giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that needeth.</hi> Doing so, <hi>each for his owne parte, you shall receaue of the Lorde the reward of righteousnesse.</hi> But seeing of our selues we are vnfit for this, let vs call
<pb facs="tcp:180988:43"/> vpon the Almightie God in this sorte:</p>
               <p>Lord our God and mercifull Father, we render thee thankes, because it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thee for the better furtheringe of thy Church, to appoint in the same, besides the Ministers of the worde, Rulers, <hi>&amp; Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> Whereby thy Congregation might be maintained in good peace and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous estate, <hi>and the poore people relieued:</hi> and that presentlie in this place thou hast graunted vnto vs men of good testimonie, and endued with thy Spirit: Wee beseeche thee, furnish them more and more of such giftes as they haue neede of in their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, namelie, the gift of wisedome, readines, and of discerning, <hi>as also of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence,</hi> to the ende that euery one may behaue him selfe duelie in his charge, the Elders in hauing a carefull regarde to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and conuersation, to the keeping out the wolues from the sheepe-folde of thy welbeloued Sonne, &amp; in admonishing and reproving the disorderlie and vnrulie. <hi>Likewise the Deacons in collecting careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and in bestowing liberally &amp; prudently the almes of the poore, as also in comforting them with thy holie word.</hi> Graunt both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Elders <hi>and vnto the Deacons,</hi> thy grace, that they may goe on constantlie in their faithfull worke, and that they neuer

                     </gap>.</note> so a godlie order of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, is as it were sinewes in the bodye, which knit and ioyne the members toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with decent order and comelines: It is a bridle to stay the wicked from their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: it is a spurr to pricke forward such as bee slow and negligent: yea and for all men it is the fathers rodde, euer in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to chastise gentlie the faults commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to cause them afterward to liue in more godlie feare and reuerence. Finallie,<note place="margin">what Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is.</note> it is an order left by the Lord our God vnto his Church, whereby men learne to frame their willes and doeings, according to the lawe of God, by instructing and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing: yea, and by correcting and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing all obstinate rebelles and cōtemners of the same.</p>
               <p>There are three causes chieflie whiche should moue the church of God to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting of Discipline. First,<note place="margin">For what causes it ought to be vsed.</note> that men of euill conuersation be not numbred among Gods children, to their fathers reproch,<note place="margin">Ephe. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> as if the Church of God were a sanctuarie
<pb facs="tcp:180988:47"/> for noughtie and vile persons. Secondlie, that the good be not infected with accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the euil: Which thing Saint Paule foresawe, when he commaunded the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians to banish from among them the incestuous adulterer,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. Galat. 5.</note> saying: A litle leauen maketh soure the whole lumpe of dowe. Thirdlie, that a man thus corrected or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, might bee ashamed of his fault, and so through repentance come to amendment:<note place="margin">2 Thes. 3. 1. Cor. 5.</note> the which thing the Apostle calleth deliuering to Satan, that his spirit may be saued in the day of the Lord: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that hee might be punished with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, to the intent his soule should not perish for euer.</p>
               <p>This censure, corrction or discipline, may rise either vppon priuate or publike occasion: priuate, as if a man offend either in manners or doctrine against thee, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish him brotherlie betweene him and thee: if so be he stubburnlie resist thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable aduertisemens, or by continuance in his fault, declare that he amendeth not, then, after he hath bene the seconde time warned in presence of two or three witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and continueth obstinatelie in his fault, he ought, as out Sauiour Christ cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, to be disclosed &amp; manifested to the Church, so that according to publike
<pb facs="tcp:180988:47"/> discipline, he either may bee reformed, or else be punished, as his fault requireth.</p>
               <p>Touching priuate admonition, three things are to bee obserued: First, that the admonitions proceed of a godlie zeale and conscience, rather seeking to winne our brother, then to slaunder him. Next, that we be assured, that his fault be reproueable by Gods worde. And finallie, that wee vse such modestie and wisedome, that if wee somewhat doubt of the matter, wherof we admonish him, yet with godlie exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he may be brought to the knowledge of his faulte.</p>
               <p>Besides priuate admonition, hauinge great vse to reforme offendours in publike Discipline, the Eldership hath power of Ecclesiasticall censures, to bee vsed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the qualitie of the offence shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p>These censures are, Admonition, Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension, excommunication: which in all tender regard and godlie zeale of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the members of Christ from infectiō of sinn, they are to vse, if they perceiue any euiil in anie man, either offensiue in exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or slaunderous in manners, or vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie his profession. As for example. If there ba anie person disobedient, trayterous, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, or couetous, an adulterer, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator,
<pb facs="tcp:180988:48"/> forsworne, theefe, bryber, false witnes bearer, blasphemer, drunkard, slaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, vsurer, or dissolute: Any heresie or secte, as papisticall, Anabaptisticall, and such like: brieflie, whatsoeuer it bee that might sport the Christian Congregation,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> yea rather whatsoeuer is not to edification, ought not to escape eyther admonition or punishment.</p>
               <p>And because it commeth to passe some time in the church of Christ, that when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedies assayed, profit nothing, they must proceede to the Apostolicall rod and correction, which is, excommunication: It is ordeyned, that nothing be attempted in that behalfe without the determination of the whole Congregation: wherin also they are to beware &amp; take good heede, that they seeme not more readie to expell from the Congregatiō, then to receiue againe those in whom they perceiue worthie fruites of repentance to appeare: neither yet to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him the hearing of Sermons,<note place="margin">Rigour in punishmēt ought to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> which is excluded from the Sacramentes and other benefites of the Church, that he may haue libertie and occasion to repente: finallie, that all punishmentes, corrections, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and admonitions stretch no further, then Gods word with mercie may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie beare.<note place="margin">Gods word is the onely rule of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</note>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:180988:48"/>
               <p>For the better execution of this holie Discipline, the Eldership of euerie parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation, is euerie weeke to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble for the ouersight and guidance of that church, that all thinges may be done to the furtherance of pietie and true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and for the correction and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of offences to the contrarie.</p>
               <p>¶ This may be sufficient for particular Congregations: for the visitation whereof and decision of causes, which can not bee ended in them and such like: Meetinges, Conferences, and Synodes of Ministers and Elders, chosen by particular Churches and Meetings, are to be helde as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters for time and place and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances shall thinke meete.</p>
